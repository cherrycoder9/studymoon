# StudyMoon Project

This is a personal project built with the Deno runtime and the Fresh framework.

## Overview

StudyMoon is one of my early projects as a programming beginner, and it's still under active development.  
The service is designed for **owners of study cafes or reading rooms**. By installing this service on desktops or laptops available in their space, members can access the website to:

- **Sign up and log in**  
- **Earn points automatically** based on usage time  
- Use those points to **redeem coupons** or benefits

For business owners, the service will provide tools to:

- **Manage membersâ€™ points and coupons**  
- **Assign penalty scores** for users who break rules

This project aims to make it easier for small study space operators to engage with their members and manage their spaces more effectively.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Deno  
- **Framework:** Fresh  
- **Database:** Supabase (planned)
